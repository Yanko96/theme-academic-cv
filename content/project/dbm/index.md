The project was done at University of Trento, under the supervision of Prof. Farid Melgani. I have had a comprehensive understanding of the reasons begind the shift from more theoretically complete and interpretable models such as Bolzmann Machine, Belief Nets, Markov Random Fields, etc, to more practicle models like Neural Networks. However, I do believe that looking for inspirations from other fields is still very promising for the development of machine learning.
