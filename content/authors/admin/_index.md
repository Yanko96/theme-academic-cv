#       Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Me

I'm Yangzhe Kong, a Computer Science Ph.D. student at George Mason University with a passion for machine learning, robotics, and AI. My journey in tech has taken me from Tongji University in China to Aalto University in Finland, and now to the US, with valuable industry experience at companies like Huawei and Nokia Bell Labs along the way. My research focuses on enhancing robot social navigation through multi-modal learning, combining my expertise in trajectory prediction, computer vision, and natural language processing. I'm always excited to tackle complex problems and push the boundaries of what's possible in AI and robotics.
